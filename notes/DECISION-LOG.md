# DECISION-LOG.md — resolved decisions (append-only)

- 2026-06-10 · **D1 Hero treatment** — owner chose to build BOTH variants in parallel
  worktrees (`feature/hero-cinematic` on :3000, `feature/hero-boot` on :3001) and
  compare live before merging a winner. Spec recommendation (A with C's chip) noted.
- 2026-06-13 · **D1 RESOLVED → A (Cinematic name)** — after live side-by-side, owner
  picked variant A. Merged `feature/hero-cinematic` to main (no-ff); both worktrees
  removed, `feature/hero-boot` deleted. Boot variant available in reflog if revived.
- 2026-06-10 · **D2 Accent color** — A, electric indigo `#5B5BF0`. Phosphor green
  `#9BE89B` stays quarantined inside terminal panes per DESIGN-SPEC.
- 2026-06-10 · **D3 Photo treatment** — A, indigo duotone for all Strip frames
  (CSS-based so B "natural color" stays a one-variable toggle during M2).
- 2026-06-10 · **IMG_6075 headshot** — owner confirmed: use ONLY with duotone
  treatment (photo reads as AI-enhanced; duotone hides the tells). Never natural.
- 2026-06-10 · **Hero glow upgrade (new fork, owner-approved)** — replace the static
  radial indigo gradient behind the hero name with a subtle Paper Shaders
  (`@paper-design/shaders-react`) ambient GPU glow. Bends PRD's "no WebGL hero"
  anti-goal, approved on condition of: graceful fallback to the static CSS gradient
  (no-JS / reduced-motion / WebGL-unavailable), no impact on LCP (hero name is text),
  shader loads after first paint. Logged in handoff/docs/DECISIONS.md as D9.
- 2026-06-10 · **Transitions stack** — Next.js 16 native View Transitions
  (`viewTransition: true`) for route changes; CSS scroll-driven animations where
  they can replace JS scroll handlers; Motion + Lenis remain the choreography core.
  New-wave component patterns (React Bits et al.) are rebuilt with our tokens, not
  installed as dependencies — keeps the site non-templated and the JS budget intact.
- 2026-06-10 · **Scaffold** — Next 16.2.9 / React 19.2.7 / Tailwind v4 / Motion 12 /
  Lenis 1.3 / zod 4. `next lint` removed in Next 16 → `lint: eslint .`, vitest for
  the nowlog parser contract test.

- 2026-06-14 · **Figure + binary dissolve (owner-directed redesign)** — the two
  raw photos in the Strip read as "just put my image". Replaced with ONE
  background-removed cutout (selfie/IMG_1547, Vision foreground mask) as a
  scroll-driven figure that mosaics in and dissolves into drifting binary bits.
  This is a second bold moment alongside now.log (CLAUDE.md rule 6) — sanctioned
  by owner. Bits use --volt/--bone (NOT phosphor; the quarantine holds). Canvas
  effect is desktop-only (perf, like the shader); mobile/reduced-motion/no-JS get
  a static indigo-duotone <Image>. Strip's two photos removed.
- 2026-06-14 · **Work section redesign → explorable terminal index** — owner found
  the card grid generic and wanted broader knowledge exposed, not just 5-6 personal
  repos. Replaced Hall-of-Fame grid with a `ls -la ./work` index: personal/ +
  client/ + field-notes/ groups, expandable rows. Learnings content = now.log study
  themes + per-project lessons (owner's explicit pick); client work from role bullets.

- 2026-06-14 · **Back/forward scroll restoration (owner-requested)** — Lenis drives
  scrolling, which defeats the browser's and Next's native scroll restoration:
  pressing Back dropped you at the top instead of where you left. Added
  `components/providers/ScrollRestoration.tsx` (mounted inside `SmoothScroll`):
  takes manual control (`history.scrollRestoration = "manual"`), snapshots the
  outgoing offset per pathname at navigation start (pushState patch + popstate +
  pagehide) into a bounded LRU in sessionStorage (12 entries = "a few steps"),
  and restores via `lenis.scrollTo(y, { immediate, force })` — or `window.scrollTo`
  under reduced motion — on genuine Back/Forward (popstate) and reload. Forward
  link clicks still go to top by design; hash deep-links (`/#contact`) are left to
  the anchor. Restore is an immediate jump, never an animated scroll, so the
  reduced-motion floor holds. No-JS safe (renders null). Owner-verified working.

- 2026-06-16 · **Round-1 refinement (owner-directed, 4 forks resolved live)** —
  (1) **whoami → boot-sequence terminal.** The floating `$ whoami` statement read
  as a generic subheader; replaced `components/message` with `components/whoami`, a
  Mac-window pane that types `whoami` / `cat role.txt` on scroll-in and reveals the
  output. Copy reused verbatim from `site.ts` `hero`+`message` (no new claims).
  Accent stays `--volt`; phosphor remains quarantined to now.log.
  (2) **ON/OFF PROD doors → pinned horizontal Journey.** Owner found the two doors
  gated experience behind a click. Replaced `components/worlds` with
  `components/journey`: a `count*100vh` section whose sticky inner track translates
  on X by scroll progress (Shopify-Editions feel) through Experience → Shipped →
  Agentic → Go-deeper panels, each opening with a shell command. Desktop pins;
  mobile / reduced-motion / no-JS stack vertically (useJourneyChoreo gate).
  (3) **Redundancy cleanup.** Homepage = curated highlights; `/work` = the single
  exhaustive index (`WorkIndex` + experience timeline + writing links). `/lab`'s
  content duplicated the field-notes/ directory → `/lab` now 301s to
  `/work#field-notes`; nav "lab" points there; removed from sitemap. `worlds` data
  + `Message`/`Worlds` components deleted.
  (4) **Schematics extended** to client/ + field-notes/ rows (owner ask): added
  `api`, `migration`, `deploy`, `loop` kinds to `Schematic`.
  Deferred to Round 2: open-source panel (GitHub stars + Notion), now.log live data
  (pushed repos / contributions / stars), figure relocation, inter-section TUI
  transitions.

- 2026-06-16 · **Back/forward restore — prod-build fix.** Owner reported the
  scroll-restoration (logged 06-14) worked in `next dev` but not on the Netlify
  build. Verified the code WAS deployed (storage key present in the live bundle), so
  it was a timing regression: a production build settles later than dev (slower
  hydration, Lenis re-measuring the restored route's height after the jump, the
  `viewTransition` DOM swap), and the one-shot `rAF×2 + 60ms` restore landed before
  that and got overridden. Fix: `ScrollRestoration` now re-asserts the saved offset
  every frame (with `lenis.resize()`) until it holds for ~3 frames or a ~0.75s cap,
  and aborts on genuine user scroll (wheel/touch/key). Still an immediate jump,
  never animated — reduced-motion/no-JS branches unchanged.

- 2026-06-16 · **Sambin Technologies — rule reversed (owner-approved, timeline-only).**
  CLAUDE.md rule #2 and CONTENT.md previously forbade ANY Sambin mention. Owner asked
  to add the Nov 2024–Jan 2025 Software Developer internship; chose the **timeline-only**
  option (no project detail, no 85%/metrics). Added one line to `experience` (site.ts);
  updated CLAUDE.md rule #2, CONTENT.md §6 timeline, and the facts registry (now permits
  the timeline line, still forbids Sambin *project work / deliverables / metrics*).

- 2026-06-16 · **Journey transition → terminal command session (owner-directed).**
  The lateral translateX slide (Round 1) read as a stock carousel. Replaced with a
  pinned terminal that, on scroll, runs `clear` (types it, wipes the screen) then types
  the next command (`uptime --career → ls ./shipped → tail -f ~/agents → cd ~`) and
  reveals its output — reversing the same way on scroll-up. useJourneyChoreo became a
  scroll-band state machine (hysteresis kills boundary thrash; rAF kickoff avoids a
  set-state-in-effect cascade; fast scroll skips intermediates to the landed band).
  Verified pacing ~1.3s via filmstrip. Desktop only; mobile / reduced-motion / no-JS
  render the four commands as a plain readable terminal stack (hard rules 3 + 5).
